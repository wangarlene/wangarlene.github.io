        <p>here's my unbearably long, highly subjective answer.
            <li>the bathhouses: from the sweet
              neighborhood sentos to the multifloor super sentos with restaurants,
              gyms, lounges. i am a die hard fan of hot and cold water therapy (10min hot, 30sec cold, 15min rest) for the relaxing, euphoric experience. i've been to over 20 bathhouses/saunas in 6 cities and i owe this addiction to japanese bathhouses, where i first discovered it </li> <li>saying ごちそうさまでした to your chef after the meal
              - we don’t really thank our chefs in north america </li><li>incredibly interesting
              food experiences. from dessert buffet chains to the sprawling gourmet
              food counter in the basement levels of department stores (depachika)
              to the abundance of self-service restaurant chains (i feel like family
              restaurants are underrated in the japanese tourism space. these places
              serve western food with japanese influence and often you order on a
              tablet, get served by a robot, and self-checkout, with very little
              human interaction if you desire! which i did after my long flight.)</li>  <li>
              the access to nature is wonderful. it’s surprisingly easy to find
              gorgeous green space, and i’m not talking about the sad flat piece of
              grass we call a park in north america. there exist many traditional
              japanese gardens, beautiful modern parks, as well as shrines and
              temples that offer a level of tranquility and beauty that can make you
              forget you’re in the largest city in the world. i've randomly discovered that
              there are white and red jellyfish in the sumida river here.</li>  <li>tourist
              traps aren’t really a thing. yes, things may be slightly more expensive or maybe a
              bit lower quality near tourist sites, but i have always felt that
              the 'tourist traps' here have never reached the same degree of outright
              scamming you often encounter in other big tourist
              destinations. </li> 
              <li> even thrifting is not the price-gouging hellscape it is back home. i found a beautiful unique wool coat with tags attached, originally priced at 30,000 yen ($300 CAD). i thrifted it for
              3000 yen ($30 CAD). warning: do not come to thrift here unless you are ready to forever be henceforth disappointed in canadian/american thrift stores</li> 
              <li> i feel less guarded here compared to many other big cities, especially as a young woman. 
              pickpocketing, being approached by strangers, the dangers of walking at night, are not nearly as
              top of mind for me here as they are elsewhere. if you lose something, there's very good odds you'll get it back. i think this all brings peace of mind if you're on vacation here — it's hard to have fun after your phone gets stolen or you lose your passport.</li></ul> <br/>

              ...more to come
