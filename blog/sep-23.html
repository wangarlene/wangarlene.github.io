          my poor sweat glands have been no match for this humid tokyo heat.
          thankfully it’s tempering down as i write this. <br /><br />it’s
          difficult to describe why precisely i love this city so much --
          truthfully, it’s the accumulation of all the little details of every
          day life here that i cherish deeply. no country is perfect, but in
          many ways my experiences here have felt refreshing for the soul.
          <br />
          if i had to summarize: <br />
          i love beautiful things and there are a LOT of them in japan; this
          whole country is a beautiful thing. <br />i love the sheer abundance
          of entertainment, nature, food, relaxation, and shopping experiences,
          made especially possible by the most gorgeous public transit system.
          what couldn’t you do here? <br />i love the attention to detail and
          how highly engineered and well-designed even the small things are. a
          very mundane example i recently discovered is the fact that the inside
          of my duvet cover here has strings on the corners that can be tied to
          these loops in the corners of my duvet and hold it in place.
          <br />
          see what i mean? the tiny little things. <br />
          (if you're interested in hearing more, i'm going to try to keep a list
          <a href="./why-tokyo.html">here</a>). <br />i’m lucky to say it’s my
          fourth time in japan in the last year and a half, but as you might
          expect, it feels very different. naturally, to not only be moving here
          but also attend school here comes with responsibility that was absent
          in all my previous time here. it’s a little jarring noticing how
          little i explored and experienced in tokyo in the last week, compared
          to how much i usually can jam into one day of being a tourist. a
          reminder, then, that everything is relative. because i've been on
          vacation here -- when i had maximum flexibility and freedom (and a
          little bit of time-constrained pressure) -- this week feels boring by
          comparison. when i didn’t have to go to city hall, learn about a new
          school system, and run around a bunch of mujis, nitoris, and daisos
          (home goods stores) to furnish my place. <br /><br />i might owe
          myself a little grace as i settle in here. sometimes i push myself in
          my pursuits to a point of counterproductivity. i’m much more aware of
          it than i used to be but i still feel this tension between gratitude
          and comfort. meaning, because i feel so lucky to be here, i feel
          motivated (and maybe pressured) to make the most of this opportunity.
          get out there, try not to recede into the comfortable. but
          realistically, the tourist itinerary is not sustainable anyhow. i do
          look forward to finding my rhythm here. <br /><br />
          i’m a little nervous about consistently updating a blog weekly and
          publicly, but documenting my life is important to the sentimental part
          of me. the format is not fully clear to me yet, but i’d like to share
          moments from the week like: <br />
          <br />
          <i>a memorable meal:</i> i’ve been almost exclusively dining out (much
          more financially accessible than it is back home), and i walked into a
          chinese restaurant because i knew i could order some much needed fibre
          with a vegetable stir fry. after i said 一人でお願いします (“for one
          please”) she replied 一个人吗？ (“for one?” … but in chinese) <br />i
          later asked her <br />> how did you know i was chinese? <br />> i
          could just tell, just like how you could probably tell i’m chinese and
          not japanese if you saw me on the street. <br />> haha i don’t know
          about that, i was raised overseas. <br />she then asks me about where
          i’m from, what i’m doing here. she even tells me to talk to her
          coworker my age who is trying to learn english. this sort of small
          talk is less common here, i was grateful to have had it there. plus
          the food was great :) <br />
          <br /><i>something that challenged me:</i> one of the hardest parts
          about learning this new language for me is getting over the
          HUMILIATION of using it knowing my japanese s*cks, especially as
          someone who is deliberate about communication and strives to come
          across exactly the way i want to. i have a bad habit of rushing
          through my ありがとうございます (“thank you”) because it used to be
          very difficult for me to say, it sounds more like ありざます. i’ve
          been trying to correct it and slow it down, and happy to say i’ve
          noticed that i’ve shaken off a lot of the fear and anxiety around
          using japanese. as when overcoming the fear of public speaking, you
          realize that no matter how painfully awkward, anything is survivable.
          i now embrace the awkwardness and if i need to, i'm not afraid to ask
          もう一度お願いします(“one more time please”) <br />
          <br />
          <i>something i learned: </i>how to do japanese laundry! specifically,
          drying stuff outside is quite foreign to me. i learned to set up a
          laundry line with the laundry pole system built into my balcony.
          <br />
          <br />i think it would be nice to ask my tokyo friends to also write a
          short guest entry about their week! <br />if there is anything you'd
          like me to write about, i would love to hear about it.
