      <p>  My days used to be filled with page after page of Young Adult fiction, until analyzing Lord of the Flies in school put my passion for books six feet under. I'm getting back into reading -- nowadays I look towards personal finance (admittedly, incredibly boring but incredibly essential), dystopian classics and personal development books.
      Here's what's on the bookshelf:</p>
      <div class="bookshelf">

        <div class="book-left">
          <img src="../images/htwfaip.jpg" alt="Front book cover of the book "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie">
          <h3>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie<h3>
          <p>(I put off reading this classic because the title seemed...aggressive, but it really should be required reading)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-right">
          <img src="../images/1984.jpg" alt="Front book cover of the book "1984" by George Orwell">
          <h3>1984 by George Orwell<h3>
          <p>(My next classic read on the ultimate "100 Books to Read Before You Die" list)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-left">
          <img src="../images/manssearchformeaning.jpg" alt="Front book cover of the book "A Mans Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl">
          <h3>  Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl<h3>
          <p>(If you're looking for something to frame a mindset about the bigger picture)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="book-right">
          <img src="../images/iwtytbr.jpg" alt="Front book cover of the book "I Will Teach You to Be Rich" by Ramit Sethi">
