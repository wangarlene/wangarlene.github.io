      <p>  My days used to be filled with page after page of Young Adult fiction, until analyzing Lord of the Flies in school put my passion for books six feet under. I'm getting back into reading -- nowadays I look towards personal finance (admittedly, incredibly boring but incredibly essential), dystopian classics and personal development books.
      Here's whats' on the bookshelf:</p>
